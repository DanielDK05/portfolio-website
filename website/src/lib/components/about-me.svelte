<h2 class="SubHeadline">About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi, my name is Daniel Kalstad. I am an aspiring software developer, with a
    big passion for writing code. I have been writing code as a hobby for about
    3-4 years now, and I now mean to find work.

    <br /> <br />

    I have attended a 2 year high school software line, and I have had a 3 week
    summer internship at
    <a href="https://www.nb.no/en/">Nasjonalbiblioteket, Mo i Rana.</a>

    <br /> <br />

    I am a structured, collected and calm person. I have always had a strong
    work ethic, along with being a quick learner. My goal is to become an
    amazing developer, and to strive for improvement every day!
